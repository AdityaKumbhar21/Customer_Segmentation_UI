## Getting Started

1. **Clone and Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   # Copy environment variables
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env file with your API configuration
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for Production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Preview Production Build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# API Configuration
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
VITE_API_ENDPOINT=/classify_customers
```

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL of your backend server
- `VITE_API_ENDPOINT`: The specific endpoint for customer classification

## API Integration

The application connects to your backend API using environment variables. Configure the following in your `.env` file:

- **Base URL**: Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to your backend server URL
- **Endpoint**: Set `VITE_API_ENDPOINT` to `/classify_customers`

The backend should:

- Accept POST requests to the configured endpoint
- Handle multipart/form-data with a file field named `'file'`
- Return customer segmentation data in the following format:

```json
[
  {
    "customer_id": "17850",
    "predicted_cluster_id": 3,
    "cluster_name": "Champions & VIPs",
    "cluster_interpretation": "Most valuable and influential customer segment...",
    "cluster_recommendations": [
      "Provide exclusive VIP treatment...",
      "Send personalized appreciation..."
    ],
    "rfm_values": {
      "MonetaryValue": 942.24,
      "Frequency": 13,
      "Recency": 0
    }
  }
]
```

## File Requirements

- **Format**: CSV files only
- **Size**: Maximum 10MB
